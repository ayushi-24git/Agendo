# Agendo

Agendo is a simple To-do list. It allows inserting a task, striking it off the list and deleting it permanently.

To have a demo, clone this repository on your local. Open index.html and try to add tasks in the list. For adding a task, click on the + button. Single click on the task strikes it off the list and marks it to be done. A double click deletes the task permanently from the list. Wishing you a Happy tasking!
